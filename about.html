        <p style="color:coral">My journey as an English language teacher began in 2015 when I started
            working as a language assistant at a school in Madrid, Spain. After 
            completeing my TEFL qualification at the University of Catalonia,
            I moved to Chile and started teaching English to training Navy cadets. 
            It was at this time that I began creating online content for my instagram
            channel @englishidiomswithizz, which is aimed at intermediate-advanced 
            students who want to learn everday english idioms.
